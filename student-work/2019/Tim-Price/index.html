		<h1>Our taste will <em>MOO</em>ve you !</h1>
		<p>Louisville Cream is a small batch gourmet ice cream company located in Louisville, KY.  We make homemade ice cream with local ingredients, produce, milk - and homemade mix-ins and baked goods! We also do catering, events, and custom flavors!</p>
		<p> We're nuts about ice cream, so every batch is special and has lots of love go into it.  We make have our own menu staple flavors, some rotating seasonal flavors, and custom flavors for catering!</p>

		<p>We started in January of 2014...because we're the kind of people who dream about ice cream in the dead of a Kentucky winter. What once was a hobby, bloomed into a legitimate affair - an affair between ice cream and man.  This love affair is deep and passionate, and we're not afraid to tell the world; we love ice cream! </p>

		<p>...Psssssssssssst!  Hey you - yeah, ice cream lover sitting in front of the screen; we can also make custom flavors!  You dream it, we can make it!

	If you'd like to have an ice cream experience like no other, give us a shout at <a href="mailto:info@louisvillecream.com">info@louisvillecream.com</a> </p>
