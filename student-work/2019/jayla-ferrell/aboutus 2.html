Joseph's Salon/Spa is an Aveda Lifestyle Salon/Spa offering a full line of beauty and wellness services. Over 30 years ago, Joseph's Salon was opened by Joe and Connie Flint who planned to operate a salon staffed with highly skilled beauty industry professionals while paying special attention to outstanding service. </p>

	<p>
Joseph’s was the first business in Kentucky to carry Aveda, the plant-based beauty product line. Joseph’s grew as an award-winning salon. In the early 90’s, Kelli Flint Campbell--daughter of Joe and Connie--took 100% ownership of the company and thus a new generation of Joseph’s began. The Salon evolved to an Aveda Lifestyle Salon and Spa with over 10,000 sq feet and 90 employees. </p>

	<p>
Joseph’s has assembled a team of technical experts and trend advisors who share in the Joseph's Salon/Spa philosophy of giving both technically and professionally. Joseph’s holds true to the original goals of technical expertise and superior service. In addition, we strive to promote an environment of excellence and wellbeing, of which both the Joseph’s team and the client want to be a part.</p>
