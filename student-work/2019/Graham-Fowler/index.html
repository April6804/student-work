		<h3> Our Story</h3>
		<p>The owners traveled 9000 miles visiting the top pizzerias in the country. They opened Coals Artisan Pizza in Louisville, Kentucky in April, 2011. We introduced the first coal-fire pizza in the state of Kentucky. Special attention is paid to the dough which is made daily using a proprietary mixing process. The dough is then cold fermented for at least 2 days. This fermentation is the basis for our flavorful, light and crispy crust. Whenever possible Ingredients are sourced locally. The pizzas can be described as American Neapolitan. Thin crust with a puffy cornicione using American ingredients.</p>
