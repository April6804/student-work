		In Tecate, Mexico, the French artist JR pasted this plaintive image on Wednesday, his first installation in Mexico. The piece, based on his photo of a 1-year-old who lives with his mother and grandparents in Tecate, is fully viewable only from the American side of the divide.
		<br>
		The idea came to JR in a dream. “Some people dream about fantasy worlds, I dream about walls,” he said in a phone interview. And though his artwork was not intended as a direct response to the Trump administration, it has extra resonance this week as the White House moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

		“I wonder, is this kid worrying about what will happen? What does he think?” JR said. “At one year old, you don’t see the frontier or which side is better.”

On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) agreed to review lower court decisions related to the termination of the DACA program. This decision follows an action taken on November 5th, 2018, by the DOJ to petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari (cert) on three DACA cases in the following federal courts — New York, Washington, D.C., and California. Traditionally, petitioning for cert is when a losing party files with the Supreme Court to ask them to review the decision of a lower court, but in this case, the Administration has requested cert in cases that are still pending with their respective federal appeals courts. By petitioning for cert, DOJ is attempting to fast-track these cases to the Supreme Court, where their ultimate goal is to end the DACA program once and for all.

Due to the uncertainty of how SCOTUS will ultimately decide these cases, if your DACA expires in the next year, we strongly encourage you to consult an immigration attorney or DOJ-accredited representative and submit your renewal application as soon as possible! You are eligible to renew if you have DACA now or have had DACA in the past. There have already been hundreds of thousands of renewals since courts first issued the injunctions that reopened the renewal process, — let’s keep it up. Remember: you have rights, and you can still renew your DACA today.
