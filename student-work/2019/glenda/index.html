When you’re undocumented, you face a lot of discrimination, and that creates a lot of fear. At United We Dream, we transform that fear into finding your voice. We empower people to develop their leadership, their organizing skills, and to develop our own campaigns to fight for justice and dignity for immigrants and all people. This is achieved through immigrant youth-led campaigns at the local, state, and federal level.

	<p>Our guiding principles are what we believe and how we operate as an organization. They were developed over 18 months and reflect the input of over 400 UWD members, including affiliate leaders, online members, a national leadership committee, staff, and our board. Together we created our “2020 Vision” and we seek to embody these guiding principles in all that we do: <br>
		-people most affected are at the forefront <br>
		-being democratic and accountable <br>
		-invest in leadership development, training, and mentoring <br>
		-create loving community <br>
		-empowering the whole person <br>
		-commited to nonviolence <br>
		-we are part of a global community <br>
	  -our stories are power</p>
