<p>Have an honest conversation
If a person says they are considering suicide
Have an honest conversation
If you think someone is thinking about suicide, assume you are the only one who will reach out. <h3>Here’s how to talk to someone who may be struggling with their mental health.</h3></p>

    <ol>
				 <li>Talk to them in private</li>
    <li>Listen to their story</li>
    <li>Tell them you care about them</li>
    <li>Ask directly if they are thinking about suicide</li>
    <li>Encourage them to seek treatment or to contact their doctor or therapist</li>
    <li>Avoid debating the value of life, minimizing their problems or giving advice</li></ol>

		<h2>Healing Conversations</h2><p>Formerly known as the Survivor Outreach Program – gives those who have lost someone to suicide the opportunity to talk with our experienced volunteers. These AFSP volunteers, who are themselves survivors of suicide loss, offer understanding and guidance in the weeks and months following a suicide death.</p>

<p>Available in person, on the phone or by video chat, our volunteers are familiar with the isolation that so often accompanies a death of this kind, and are able to show suicide loss survivors a way forward into a world of support, by creating an opportunity for the newly bereaved to speak openly with, and ask questions of, someone who has been there, too, and truly gets it.</p>

<p>When someone contacts us to request a conversation, we will ask them some questions about their loss, so that we may match them with a suitable volunteer who has experienced a similar loss. Their peer support volunteer will contact them to schedule a conversation at a convenient time and, in the case of in-person visits, at a comfortable location of the person’s choice.</p>

		 <h3> Medications</h3> <p>Many medications are available to treat depression, the most common of which are antidepressants. About 22 medications are currently approved by the FDA. Since there is no accurate test to match a person’s symptoms and complaints with the right medication, there is no way to know which drug will work best for a particular person. The person who may be depressed should discuss with their doctor the medication choice and how to take it, as well as the potential side effects. Sometimes there is the need to try a few different medications before finding the one that gives the best result with minimum side effects.</p>

<p>When the optimal dose with the best medication is achieved, the antidepressant may take from 4–12 weeks to achieve maximum benefit, but it is possible for one or two symptoms to improve in the first few weeks.</p>
		 <h3>CBT</h3> <p>The most common types of psychotherapy for depression are cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), behavioral activation (BH), and cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP). There is clear evidence from research studies that combining antidepressants with any one of these psychotherapies is the best treatment for chronic depression, meaning that the patient has had a depressive illness for two years or more.</p>
