			<h1>Helping <br>is what we do</h1>
			<h4>Our Group</h4>
			<p> Before we started our non profit orgnization we knew we needed to do something with the way things were ran and controlled by coorperate. Cooperations have been trying to mass produce our groceries for years, putting pesticides, and chymicals in our food for them to grow and produce alot faster than they originally should.  which is why we made a movement and started this non profit orginization called <strong>ROME</strong> thats happening right here in Kentucky! we are now prividing care to our farmers and their families by buying there fresh grown organic crops that have zero pesticides and GMO's.</p>
			<p> Along with the care we give to our farmers we also give over whelming love to our local animals! such as cows, sheep, llamas, alpachas, deer, chicken, ducks, goats and plenty of farm dogs that help keep the animals in their proper heards.  Because of all the thanks we've been getting from our local farms we are now setting up events for friends and family to come to any one of our locations and come hang out with the animals and pet them to your hearts content. now started on the month of April.</p>

			<h1>Be apart of the solution</h1>
			<p>Buying locally has been all the rage for a while now. It’s the reason why farmers markets and 100 mile dinners are all the rage. Consumers love the idea of knowing where their products are coming from and supporting local businesses. But what does buying locally do for the environment?</p>
			
			<p>One of the most important ways buying locally helps the environment is by reducing your food miles. By shopping locally, you are purchasing goods produced in your local community. Conversely, when you shop at the grocery store, many of the food items you buy travel over 1500 miles to reach your plate. By cutting down on these miles, you are reducing the environmental impact of your food. Local food doesn’t create large carbon footprints through overseas plane travel or long truck trips. This cuts down on fuel consumption and air pollution. There isn’t a need for shipping facilities, packing facilities or refrigeration.</p>
