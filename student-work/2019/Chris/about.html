			<h2>Conserving the Future of the Rhino</h2>	
		
			<p>Here at Helping Rhinos we are a dedicated and innovative group of conservationists. Our partners are equally as dedicated to the conservation of the declining rhinocerous population!<br><br>
				
			We are working in Kenya currently in an attempt to increase its rhino population back up to 2000 by the year 2030.<br><br>
				
			In addition to increasing the current rhino population we also invest in local comminities to increase awareness and education benefits for any interested</p>

			<h2>Rhino Saving Mission</h2>
			<p>Of the Less than 30,000 rhinos left in the world it's up to us to protect them. The horn of a rhino fetches a hefty price to poachers and there have been cases where they are not killed, but harvested for their horns and left to die in the wild.
			<br><br>Despite the efforts of many poaching still proves to be the primary threat to the current low rhino population as sad as it can be. With the help of you and your participation our efforts will not go to waste. 
			<br><br>Our main goal is to protect the remaining rhino population and help them grow back into a healthy non endangered state of living.
			<br><br>Join our cause today!</p>
