			<h1 class="help">Volunteer Mission</h1>
			<p>In order to provide life-saving support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer &amp; questioning (LGBTQ) youth, The Trevor Project recruits passionate volunteers to staff our crisis intervention services. Volunteers are vital to Trevor’s work, and are instrumental in providing a safe and secure connection for LGBTQ youth to reach out. Trevor’s team welcomes individuals of all backgrounds into our volunteer family and our team works to uplift, recognize, and support our growing volunteer network.
			<br>
			The life-saving work of The Trevor Project would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible volunteers. Trevor’s volunteers have, over time, saved countless young lives and supported the well-being of hundreds of thousands of LGBTQ youth.</p>

				<h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
					<p>Trevor offers a wide variety of opportunities for volunteers to get involved in our life-saving work. Below are opportunities for ongoing engagement with The Trevor Project. <b>Please note that volunteers must be at least 18 years old to apply.</b></p>
				<h2>TrevorChat &amp; TrevorText (<em>Anywhere in the United States</em>)</h2>
					<p>TrevorChat/TrevorText volunteers are trained to answer chat messages or texts online from young people who are struggling with issues such as coming out, LGBTQ identity, depression, and suicide. Volunteers need access to a computer in a private location with a strong internet connection, and should be comfortable with instant messaging and with using the internet. TrevorChat/TrevorText volunteers must be able to serve a minimum of a one-year commitment, with three to four 3-hour virtual shifts per month.</p>

					<p>TrevorChat/TrevorText volunteers undergo a 40-hour virtual training including webinar lectures, roleplays, and monitored shifts. Throughout this training, volunteers will learn about gender identity, suicidology, risk factors for LGBTQ young people, and Trevor’s Crisis Support Model to prepare them to speak with youth in crisis.</p>
				<h2>TrevorLifeline (<em>Los Angeles or New York City</em>)</h2>
					<p>TrevorLifeline volunteers are trained to answer calls on our 24/7 Lifeline from young people who are feeling suicidal or need a safe, non-judgmental place to talk. This is an onsite volunteer opportunity, and those interested need to live near our Call Centers in Los Angeles and New York City. TrevorLifeline volunteers must be able to serve a minimum of a one-year commitment, with two 4-hour, on-site shifts per month.</p>
				
					<p>TrevorLifeline volunteers undergo a 40-hour in-person training over two weekends, with additional follow-up training and monitored shifts. Throughout this training, volunteers will learn about gender identity, suicidology, risk factors for LGBTQ young people, and Trevor’s Crisis Support Model to prepare them to speak with youth in crisis.</p>
				<h2>Advocacy Volunteers (<em>Anywhere in the United States</em>)</h2>
				
					<p>Advocacy volunteers conduct research related to our current local, state, and federal campaigns that advance laws and policies supporting LGBTQ youth in crisis. Some current projects include protecting LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy, advocating for LGBTQ competent suicide prevention policies in schools, and encouraging states to collect data reflecting sexual orientation and gender identity at time of death. Advocacy volunteers commit to volunteering one to two hours a week consistently for a minimum of a year.</p>
