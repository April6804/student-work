			<h3 class="slide-h1">So Who Is Trevor?</h3>
			<p>
				Trevor is the name of the film written by James Lescesne in 1994. Lescesne brought forward an character he created named Trevor. Trevor being a young queer indiviual raised in the bible belt, we watch as he struggles with coming to terms that he's gay. Faced with prejudice by the people closest to him, eventually causing Trevor to take his own life when he felt like he no one else to turn to.</p>
			<p>
				The release of Trevor started a national movement. When the film released on HBO in 1998, many people began to realise there was no place for people like Trevor to turn to. Director Peggy Rajski saw this and began recruiting mental health experts to help build a nationwide hotline. On the night of the release the Trevor Lifeline was born.</p> 
			<p>
				The Trevor Project has been growing ever since, other programs being introduced such as TrevorChat, TrevorSpace, and Trevor Education. All built with one mission, crisis intervention and suicide prevention.

				<h1 class="slide-h1">We've Been Doing Some Research.</h1>
					<p>The Trevor Project is committed to producing innovative research that brings new knowledge and clinical implications to the field of suicidology. To accomplish this, The Trevor Project takes a two-pronged approach.

					1. We partner with external research organizations (such as academic institutions) to carry out complex investigations that range from program evaluations to interventions.

					2. We monitor, analyze, and evaluate existing data collected from Trevor-served youth to produce insights into vulnerable populations, suicidal risk factors, and social factors influencing suicidal ideation and attempts.</p>
				<h2 class="slide-h1">Current Research Projects</h2>
					<p>The Trevor Project is currently working on a program evaluation of its crisis services in conjunction with the University of Southern California (USC) School of Social Work and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. The first in Trevor’s 18 year history, this program evaluation will provide concrete data around the crisis intervention and suicidal de-escalation that is central to Trevor’s mission. We look forward to publishing the results of this evaluation in a variety of outlets starting in late 2016.</p>
				
					<p>The Trevor Project and faculty from the University of Rochester are collaborating on the creation, testing, and training of machine learning models to inform the development of a web-based suicide prevention intervention for diverse LGBTQ communities. This project aims to address health concerns of LGBTQ youth through Internet- and emerging technology-based approaches. These research projects are supported by Grant SRG-0-200-17 from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention as well as from the University of Rochester CTSA award number KL2TR000095 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health. The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsors.</p>
				
					<p>The Trevor Project is also examining the relationship between gender identity and suicide risk through analyses of internal data. We anticipate publishing a manuscript on this topic by the end of 2016.</p>
