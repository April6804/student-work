				<h3>Kentucky earns failing grades in new tobacco control report, Lung Association calls on officials to Support Smokefree Students Legislation to save lives</h3>

<p>Tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death and disease, taking an estimated 480,000 lives every year. This year's "State of Tobacco Control" report from the American Lung Association finds Kentucky earned nearly across-the-board failing grades on its efforts to reduce and prevent tobacco use. The American Lung Association calls on Kentucky officials to pass Smokefree Students legislation and increase funding for tobacco prevention and control in order to save lives.</p>

<p>The need for Kentucky to take action to protect youth from tobacco is more urgent than ever, with youth e-cigarette use reaching epidemic levels due to a 78 percent increase in high school e-cigarette use from 2017 to 2018, according to results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey. This equals one million additional kids beginning to use e-cigarettes, placing their developing bodies and lungs at risk from the chemicals in e-cigarettes as well as a lifetime of addiction to a deadly product. This has caused the U.S. Surgeon General to declare e-cigarette use among young people an epidemic in an Advisory issued in December 2018.</p>

<p>"In Kentucky, our smoking rates remain at 24.6 percent. Tobacco use is a serious addiction and we need to invest in the proven measures to prevent and reduce tobacco use outlined in 'State of Tobacco Control'," said American Lung Association Advocacy Director, Shannon Baker. "The report provides a roadmap on how to save lives, but much work remains to be done in communities across Kentucky to prevent and reduce tobacco use."</p>

<p>The 17th annual "State of Tobacco Control" report grades states and the federal government on policies proven to prevent and reduce tobacco use, and finds that while Kentucky has increased funding for its state tobacco prevention program by over $1 million this fiscal year, elected officials must do more to save lives and ensure all Kentucky residents benefit from reductions in tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke:</p>

<ul><li>Funding for State Tobacco Prevention Programs – Grade F</li>
<li>Strength of Smokefree Workplace Laws - Grade F</li>
<li>Level of State Tobacco Taxes - Grade F</li>
<li>Coverage and Access to Services to Quit Tobacco - Grade C</li>
<li>Minimum Age of Sale for Tobacco Products to 21 – Grade F</li></ul>
<p>The American Lung Association encourages Kentucky to fully fund tobacco control efforts at levels recommended by the CDC, and in particular, this year's report noted the need to focus on Smokefree Students legislation.</p>

<p>If Kentucky would increase funding for tobacco control programs, they would have a powerful opportunity to help further reduce and prevent tobacco use, including supporting communities that still use tobacco at higher rates and who have been targeted by the tobacco industry. An investment in prevention is especially important given the skyrocketing number of youth who are using e-cigarettes. Despite Kentucky receiving $507,300,000 from tobacco settlement payments and tobacco taxes, the state does not fund tobacco control efforts at levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the largest legal settlement in U.S. history – the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky receives millions of dollars every year from this settlement, and we believe the funds should be used to support the health of our communities, and to help smokers quit and prevent tobacco use," said Shannon Baker.</p>

<p>"State of Tobacco Control" 2019 provides a blueprint that states and the federal government can follow to put in place proven policies that will have the greatest impact on reducing tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke in the U.S. The real question is: Will lawmakers in Kentucky end their failure to act and take this opportunity to achieve lasting reductions in tobacco-related death and disease?"</p>

				<h3>Today’s epidemic is due in large part to FDA’s decision to not enforce the law
				</h3>

<p>Statement of Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association, in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) release today of the draft guidance for the tobacco industry regarding “Modifications to Compliance Policy for Certain Deemed Tobacco Products”:</p>

<p>“FDA’s latest proposal to address the e-cigarette epidemic falls far short of what is needed to end the e-cigarette epidemic. With this guidance, FDA continues to take half measures that will not protect our nation’s children from the predatory marketing practices of the tobacco industry. Until FDA is willing to take meaningful action by removing all flavored tobacco products, including mint and menthol, from the marketplace, America’s youth remain at high risk for a lifetime of addiction to tobacco products. </p>

<p>“In November, along with my counterparts at our major public health partners, I sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., outlining key principles and actions that were needed to halt the e-cigarette epidemic. Unfortunately, today’s guidance fails to meet these principles – including FDA’s continued failure to enforce the Tobacco Control Act and require all e-cigarettes, cigars and hookah go through premarket review. FDA cannot rely on voluntary efforts by the tobacco industry, nor should FDA only act to restrict sales. </p> 

<p>“The youth e-cigarette epidemic is in large part due to FDA’s failure in July 2017 to enforce the Tobacco Control Act. Had FDA moved forward with the 2018 requirement that all e-cigarettes, cigars and other newly deemed products go through the premarket review process, youth e-cigarette use would be far lower than it is today. The American Lung Association warned then, as we do now: There is no question that the 2017 announcement undermined key public health protections designed to protect the health of Americans and our nation’s children. We noted that ‘of particular concern is the long and unreasonable delay for newly-regulated tobacco products to submit tobacco product applications for FDA review as required under the final deeming rule.’</p>

<p>“In our comments on the draft guidance, the American Lung Association will urge FDA to require all flavored cigars through premarket review immediately. FDA has the legal authority to remove all flavored cigars from the marketplace that are not appropriate for the protection of the public health. The question is whether they will now act quickly to use this authority to protect our kids.</p>

<p>“In 2017, the American Lung Association and partners filed a lawsuit against the FDA for its failure to enforce the Tobacco Control Act and the ‘deeming’ rule. The fundamental reasons for this lawsuit remain now as they did then: FDA’s delays of reviewing these products violates the law.”</p>
