			<p>Physical Abuse
		The definition of physical abuse, according to the New York State Office of Children and Family Services, is: "Non-accidental use of force that results in bodily injury, pain, or impairment. This includes, but is not limited to, being slapped, burned, cut, bruised or improperly physically restrained."1 Physical abuse is not limited to children and can happen to adults of any age. Neglect is also considered an aspect of physical abuse and this type of abuse often happens when one adult cares for another; such as in the case of an adult child caring for a parent.</p>

		<p>Physical abuse often occurs alongside other forms of abuse such as financial, sexual abuse and emotional abuse. Physical abusers use their abusive behaviors to try to control their victims. </p>

		<h2>Who Suffers from Physical Abuse?</h2>


		<p>While anyone can suffer from physical abuse, physical abuse victims are most often women and often:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Frail elderly</li>
			<li>Developmentally disabled</li>
			<li>Mentally ill</li>
			<li>Physically disabled</li>
			<li>Substance abusers</li>
			<li>Intimate partners</li>
		</ul>
		<p>While it is never the fault of the victim, victims of physical abuse often feel shame and guilt over the abuse and hide the abuse from others. Victims are also typically afraid of what would happen if the physical abuse were found out. Unfortunately, this often allows physical abuse to go on unreported.
