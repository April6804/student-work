		<h1>Who We Are </h1>
		<p>We are a worldwide ministry in which millions of children reap the benefits of one man's clear, God-given vision.More than 65 years ago, Rev. Everett Swanson flew to South Korea to minister to American troops fighting in the Korean War. During his time there, he grew increasingly troubled by the sight of hundreds of war orphans living on the streets, abandoned by society.</p>

<p>One morning he saw city workers scoop up what looked like piles of rags and toss them into the back of a truck. He walked up to the truck for a closer look — and was horrified to see that the "piles" were not rags, but the frozen bodies of orphans who had died overnight in the streets.</p>

<p>Appalled, Rev. Swanson began including this experience into his revival meetings, and Christians responded by donating funds to purchase rice and fuel for the orphans. Within 10 years, 108 orphanages and homes in South Korea were receiving support.</p>

	   <h1>
WE ARE "SUFFERING WITH" CHILDREN IN NEED</h1>
	   <p>The etymology of the word compassion stems from the Latin com meaning "with, together" and the Latin pati "to suffer." Compassion literally means to suffer with.</p>

<p>Compassion, suffering with another person, combines sympathy with an active response or a desire to help. Because we have compassion, we want to act and lessen someone else's suffering. This desire to act is what differentiates compassion from empathy, understanding or sharing the feelings of others.
We take a long-term approach to child development by investing in and for the life of each child.</p>

<p>Through our holistic child development model, we blend physical, social, economic and spiritual care together to help children in poverty fully mature in every facet of life and transcend what is often a generational legacy of poverty. We deliver whole-life care, by way of our frontline church partners, that is personal, individualized, relational, and tailored to the child's age, gender, health, culture and family situation.</p>

	<h1>What We Do </h1>
	 <p>WE RELEASE CHILDREN FROM POVERTY IN JESUS' NAME </p>

<p>That is our mission, which we work to achieve through a holistic approach to child development. We carefully blend physical, social, economic and spiritual care together…in Jesus' name. </p>
<p>WE HELP DEVELOP CHILDREN INTO ALL GOD INTENDS THEM TO BE</p>

<p>Child development equips children today with skills to succeed tomorrow. Holistic child development provides opportunities that encourage the healthy development of all aspects of a child — spiritually, physically, socially, emotionally, and even economically. </p>

<p>Holistic child development means we begin assisting a child in poverty, in some cases, when the child is still in the womb, and it means we go all the way through young adulthood with the child. </p>

<p>Holistic child development requires a long-term approach and goes beyond simple involvement in the life of a child. It involves long-term dedication and perseverance, and it changes as a child’s needs change. Holistic child development is tailored to a child's age, gender, health, culture and family situation. </p>

WE DO ALL OF OUR WORK THROUGH LOCAL CHURCHES </p>

<p>We work with thousands of local churches around the world, and each church partner tailors our holistic child development model to the contextualized needs of the children in its community, to best deliver the whole-life care the children need. </p>

<p>We work primarily through child sponsorship, but also have specific initiatives to help babies and mothers, to develop future leaders, and to meet critical needs. </p>
