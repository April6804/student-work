			<h1>Sponsor a child today!</h1>
			<p>When you sponsor a child, you’ll be personally connected with a boy or girl who will know your name and treasure the thought that you care. Your support of $38 per month provides life-changing opportunities such as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>an opportunity to attend or stay in school</li>
			<li>medical care, which often saves lives</li>
			<li>nourishing food</li>
			<li>mentoring and a safe environment through a local evangelical church</li>
				<li>and most important, opportunities to hear the gospel.</li></ul>

	   		<p>Compassion child sponsorship works! Millions of children have “graduated” from our program and are now responsible, fulfilled Christian adults. Allow God to work through you in the life of a child in poverty.</p>
		   <h1>What makes child sponsorship with Compassion unique?</h1>
		   <p>Sponsoring a child with Compassion is the most cost-effective way to end extreme child poverty. It not only addresses a child’s immediate physical needs, it also builds self-esteem and self-respect. Although these are similarities across other child sponsorship programs, Compassion’s approach is unique because we are:</p>

		   <ul>
			   <li>Christ-Centered.
In response to God’s call to care for the poor, Compassion gives hope to the hopeless, meeting practical needs and sharing the good news about Jesus in a culturally relevant, unconditional way to all we serve.</li>
		  <li>Child-Focused.
Our child sponsorship ministry connects one child with one sponsor to help the child achieve his or her God given potential. Sponsors write and receive letters, pray for and encourage their sponsored children and may even visit their children.</li>
		 <li>Church-Based.
Every sponsored child is linked with a Christ-centered church in his or her community. Compassion partners with over 7,500 evangelical church partners in 25 countries around the world.</li></ul>
