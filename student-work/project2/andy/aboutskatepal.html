		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
			<p>SkatePal is a non-profit organisation that works with communities throughout Palestine to enhance the lives of young people and promote the benefits of skateboarding.
Since 2013, our ongoing presence and award-winning projects have reached hundreds of young people across the West Bank and won acclaim and recognition from supporters around the world.
We are run by a committed team of local and international volunteers who, through teaching skate classes, building skateparks and providing equipment, are enabling an ever-growing number of Palestinian skaters to empower themselves and inspire the next generation of Palestinian youth.</p></div>

		<h1>Why Palestine?</h1>
			<p>More than half of all Palestinians living in the occupied territories are under 21 years old.

Yet for many young people across the West Bank and Gaza, cultural, educational and sporting opportunities are severely limited.

Help us support the fast-growing skateboarding community in Palestine. </p>

			<h1>Why Skateboarding?</h1>
			<p>Skateboarding is one of the most inclusive sports in the world. It instantly dissolves barriers between class, race, age and gender.

Skateboarding engages youth, relieves stress and helps to build confidence and form long lasting friendships.

Skateboarding isn’t hierarchical - it doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or a professional, a child or an adult. 

Skateboarding is fun!</p>
