					<h3>The Stigma</h3>
						<p>While abortion is the most talked about service that Planned Parenthood provides it is actually a service that isn't used as much as it is made out to be. From the above list you can see that Planned Parenhood offers many other services to those who take advantage of them. For decades Planned Parenthood, has worked to build a world where all people have access to the care they need and all people have full control of their own bodies and can determine their own destinies.
						</p>
					<h3>Facts are Facts</h3>
						<p>In 2015, 2.4 million people relied on approximately 650 Planned Parenthood health centers for affordable, high-quality reproductive health services. Planned Parenthood health centers have continued to provide care to all people — regardless of gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation. As a reliable source for nonjudgmental health care, Planned Parenthood health centers are expanding services to provide more care to trans people and men. In fact, men comprise 11% of Planned Parenthood’s patients across the country.</p>
