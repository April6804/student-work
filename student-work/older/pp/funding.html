				<h3>Let's Talk Defunding</h3>
					<p>Defunding Planned Parenthood does not mean what it sounds like. Planned Parenthood does not receive a blank check from the federal or state government. Defunding refers to stopping Planned Parenthood from being able to be reimbursed for providing services to people who rely on Medicaid insurance or who are eligible for free or reduced fee services through the Title X program. Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania (PPWP) would lose an estimated $650,000 annually if excluded from Medicaid Insurance and the impact of losing Title X funding would be an estimated $750,000 annually. This is nearly 30% of our annual budget. Title X and Medicaid insurance are only used to pay for family planning services such as preventive exams, screening services and birth control. A federal law, the Hyde Amendment, is already in place to block federal funding from going to abortion services and PPWP is audited annually to verify our compliance.</p>
					<br>
					So many begin to ask if Planned Parenthood is defunded why they can't just go somewhere else... well the idea that other providers could absorb Planned Parenthood’s patients has been resoundingly dismissed by experts. In fact, Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, called the idea “ludicrous.”Sara Rosenbaum, a noted Community Health Center expert, added that “the assertion that community health centers could step into a breach of this magnitude is simply wrong and displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how the health care system works.”
