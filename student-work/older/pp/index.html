					<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
						<p>Our expert nurses, doctors, educators, and health center staff are dedicated to bringing high-quality, affordable care to every member of their community. One in five women in the U.S. has chosen Planned Parenthood for health care at least once in her life.
						</p>

						<p>Our health centers provide a wide range of confidential, safe, expert health care. The majority of Planned Parenthood’s services are preventive: care that helps prevent unintended pregnancies with birth control and sex education, reduce the spread of STDs through testing and treatment, and screen for cervical, breast, and other cancers. Attentive physicians, nurse practitioners, and other staff take time to talk with you, so you’ll have an honest, supportive, non-judgmental space to ask questions and make informed decisions about your health and wellbeing.
