		<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
		<p>Our mission is to secure a future for elephants and to sustain the beauty and ecological integrity of the places they live; to promote man’s delight in their intelligence and the diversity of their world, and to develop a tolerant relationship between the two species.Save the Elephants (STE) works to secure a future for elephants in a rapidly changing world. To battle the current surge in ivory poaching, the STE/WCN Elephant Crisis Fund is identifying and supporting the most effective global partners to stop poaching, thwart traffickers and end demand for ivory. Leaders in elephant science, STE also provides cutting-edge scientific insights into elephant behavior, intelligence, and long-distance movement and applies them to the long-term challenges of elephant conservation.</p>

				<h3>Research and Monitoring</h3>
				<p>We conduct vital research on elephant behaviour and ecology and pioneered GPS radio tracking in Africa to provide fresh insight into the life of elephants. After 18 years of intensive monitoring the elephants of Samburu are one of the world’s best-studied populations. We also assist in implementing a UN-level programme to monitor the illegal killing of elephants. Our solid scientific data has helped shift international policy towards a better future for the species.</p>

				<h3>Elephant Protection</h3>
				<p>We work with wildlife departments, protected area managers and communities to assist their efforts to defend elephants against ivory poachers and traffickers. We develop and deploy cutting edge tracking systems to monitor and protect elephants. Through our Elephant Crisis Fund we have supported more than 49 partners in the implementation of over 145 different projects in 29 different countries (September 2018) aimed at stopping the killing, stopping the trafficking and ending the demand for ivory.</p>

				<h3>Human-Elephant Co-Existence</h3>
				<p>Africa’s human population is set to double by 2050, creating enormous pressures for elephants. As farmland spreads and infrastructure developments fragment habitat, elephants are being forced into increasing conflict with people. STE provides information on elephant movements for landscape planners to protect rangeland and creates innovative solutions to prevent elephants from raiding crops, such as our Elephants &amp; Bees project.</p>

				<h3>Spreading Awareness Globally</h3>
				<p>Elephants are intelligent creatures with complex levels of consciousness with a profound role in human cultures as well as African ecosystems. We share our awareness of their importance both locally and internationally through films, publications, a computerised elephant library, a news service, social networks and our website. We involve local people in research and education to develop a conservation ethic based on local knowledge and elephant needs, and recognize that the best ambassadors for elephants are the people with whom they share their land.</p>
